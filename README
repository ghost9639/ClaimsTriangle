Basic and advanced claims triangle modelling.

METHODOLOGY

    Compile claims data in a development triangle
    Calculate age-to-age factors
    Calculate averages of the age-to-age factors
    Select claim development factors
    Select tail factor
    Calculate cumulative claim development factors
    Project ultimate claims
    Use Mack Model to predict total loss


Claims data is taken from the ChainLadder package on R.

First, for a manual model projecting losses:

- I calculated age-to-age factors -> This was easily done by an R function that calculates culmulative factor differences moving up the claims triangle,

- I made a log-linear extrapolation of the age-to-age factors -> linear regression on transformed factors over development years,

- I used the extrapolation of factors to project claims for all years going forwards,

- I summed up (projected) future claims in order to get an estimate for future losses.



Then, for a Mack Model projecting losses using the ChainLadder package:

- I called the library, feeding it the correct data and specifications,

- Checked whether key linear regression assumptions were met in the model,

- Made minor adjustments to reduce key trend issues.
