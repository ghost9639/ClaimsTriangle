Basic Claims Triangle gimmicks



METHODOLOGY

    Compile claims data in a development triangle
    Calculate age-to-age factors
    Calculate averages of the age-to-age factors
    Select claim development factors
    Select tail factor
    Calculate cumulative claim development factors
    Project ultimate claims


Portfolio Generation:
 - need to define a random claims function, monotonic decreasing
 - need to generate random triangle of claims
